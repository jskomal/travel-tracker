# Travel Tracker
---
### Overview

Travel Tracker is an interactive and accessible website that tracks a user's past, current, and upcoming trips for a travel agent.
In the main view, after logging in, the user can see all of their trips and even book a new trip to be approved by the agent.

This app was built using Javascript, HTML, and CSS bundled with Webpack. It uses dayjs for QoL regarding dates in JS, and was tested with Mocha and Chai, and runs locally with a bundled server

- the user can see all of their trips
- the user can filter to see specfic date ranges of trips
- the user can book a new trip and see an estimated cost for that trip
- the user can see how much they have spent in the current year so far
